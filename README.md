# dolphinos
	This is new dolphinos. It is a new beginning!
	I chose the edk2 to build my bootload.efi in uefi. It doesn't like before we use the BIOS to boot our os.
	BuildToolsInit.sh is a script that automatically deploys edk2.
	How do you run use this script?
	Frist of all, You need clone dolphin.git like this:
	>:git clone https://github.com/xubenji/dolphin.git
	Then, you need go to the work directory.
	>:cd dolphinos/dolphin
	You can run this script like this: 
	>:bash BuildToolsInit.sh
	This script build OVMF.fd by default.
